## About

This project is a set of notes about python.
It is not aimed at beginners, it is aimed at people with working knowledge of python already and should be treated as a reference for 'things not to forget exist'.

Each file will have comments to explain the functionality being demonstrated and should be run via the command line with `python filename.py`
